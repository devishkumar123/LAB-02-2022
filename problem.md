Objective 3: ALGORITHM
â€¢	Task 01

1. Take two inputs: N (the divisor) and n (the number to check)
2. Check if N is zero. If so, return an error message ("Cannot divide by zero!")
3. Calculate the remainder of n divided by N (n/N)
4. If the remainder is zero, then N is a divisor of n
5. If N is a divisor, check if N is even or odd by checking the remainder of N divided by 2
 (N / 2)
6. If the remainder is zero, then N is even. Otherwise, N is odd
