Objective 3: ALGORITHM
•	Task 01

1. Take two inputs: N (the divisor) and n (the number to check)
2. Check if N is zero. If so, return an error message ("Cannot divide by zero!")
3. Calculate the remainder of n divided by N (n/N)
4. If the remainder is zero, then N is a divisor of n
5. If N is a divisor, check if N is even or odd by checking the remainder of N divided by 2
 (N / 2)
6. If the remainder is zero, then N is even. Otherwise, N is odd







Objective 3: ALGORITHM
•	Task 02

1. Ask the user to enter number 1 

2. Ask the user to enter number 2

3. Ask the user to enter sign (+, -, *, /, %)

4. Use a switch-case statement or if-else statements to determine which operation to perform based on the sign input

5. Perform the operation:
    - If sign is '+', return num1 + num2
    - If sign is '-', return num1 - num2
    - If sign is '*', return num1 * num2
    - If sign is '/', return num1 / num2 (division by zero error)
    - If sign is '%', return num1 % num2 (division by zero error)

6. Display the result
